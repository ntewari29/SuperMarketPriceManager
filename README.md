# Development Methodology?  
Super Market Price Management System, will be developed following the guidelines of Test-driven development (TDD), a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

The following sequence of steps is generally followed:
1. Add a test 
2. Run all tests and see if the new one fails 
3. Write some code 
4. Run tests 
5. Refactor code 
6. Repeat
